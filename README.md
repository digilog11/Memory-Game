# Memory-Game

Play a game of Memory in your browser. For up to two players. You can adjust the size of the memory cards and the number of cards you want to play with. 

You can also personalize the pictures. Just put the pictures you want in the "pictures"-folder. I recommend using square pictures. The images have to be named numerically starting with 0 and the file extension has to be ".jpg". If you want to use more than 12 pictures you also have to change the variable "number_pictures" in "main.js" to the number of images in the pictures-folder.

Tested only on Firefox.
